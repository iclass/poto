# Clear Conversation Fix

## Problem
The `clear` command was **archiving** the conversation instead of **clearing** it, which meant:
- Old conversation history was still loaded when making new requests
- Previous messages appeared in new conversations
- User expected a fresh start but got old context

## Root Cause
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect behavior):
private async clearConversationHistory(): Promise<void> {
    // This ARCHIVES the conversation, doesn't clear it
    const success = await this.chatServerModuleProxy.archiveCurrentConversation();
}
```

## Solution
```typescript
// AFTER (correct behavior):
private async clearConversationHistory(): Promise<void> {
    // This actually CLEARS the conversation
    const success = await this.chatServerModuleProxy.clearCurrentConversation();
}
```

## What I Added
1. **New RPC Method**: `clearCurrentConversation()` in `ChatServerModule`
2. **Updated Client**: Changed `clearConversationHistory()` to call the new method
3. **Proper Clearing**: Uses `dialogueJournal.clearConversation(user)` to actually clear the conversation

## Result
- ✅ `clear` command now actually clears conversation history
- ✅ No old messages appear in new conversations
- ✅ Fresh start for each conversation after clear
- ✅ Server-side conversation state is properly reset

## Test
```bash
> say hi
[AI responds with context]

> clear
✅ Conversation history cleared successfully

> say hi only
[AI responds without old context - fresh conversation]
```

The conversation should now be truly cleared and not carry over old messages!
