# Testing Reasoning Commands

## Updated Commands

The reasoning commands have been updated to properly display AI thinking process:

### 1. **Enable Reasoning**
```
> reasoning on
âœ… Reasoning enabled - AI thinking process will be displayed in real-time
```

### 2. **Check Status**
```
> reasoning
ðŸ§  Reasoning: enabled
```

### 3. **Customize Reasoning Color**
```
> color reasoning brightBlue
âœ… Reasoning color changed to brightBlue

> color reasoning magenta
âœ… Reasoning color changed to magenta
```

### 4. **View All Commands**
```
> help
```
Now shows:
- `reasoning on  - Enable reasoning (AI thinking displayed)`
- `color <ai|user|reasoning> <color> - Change colors`

## How It Works Now

When you enable reasoning:

1. **Real-time thinking display**: AI reasoning appears in gray (or your chosen color)
2. **Main content display**: AI responses appear in AI color
3. **SimpleStreamPacket streaming**: Uses the new packet-based system
4. **Interruption support**: Ctrl+C works during both reasoning and content streaming

## Example Session

```bash
# Start the client
bun run start-client

# Enable reasoning
> reasoning on
âœ… Reasoning enabled - AI thinking process will be displayed in real-time

# Customize reasoning color
> color reasoning brightMagenta
âœ… Reasoning color changed to brightMagenta

# Chat with reasoning display
> What is the capital of France?
[AI thinking in bright magenta]
Let me think about this... France is a country in Europe...
The capital of France is Paris.

# Check status
> reasoning
ðŸ§  Reasoning: enabled

# Disable reasoning
> reasoning off
âœ… Reasoning disabled
```

The system now properly displays the AI's thinking process in real-time when reasoning is enabled!
