# Reasoning Display Fix

## Problem
The reasoning commands were working in the client, but the AI's thinking process wasn't being displayed because:

1. **Missing RPC Method**: The `chatWithReasoning` method wasn't exposed as a public RPC method
2. **Client-Server Mismatch**: The client was calling a method that wasn't available on the server

## Solution

### 1. **Added Public RPC Method**
```typescript
// In ChatServerModule.ts
async *postChatWithReasoning(
    message: string, 
    options: {
        jsonOutput?: boolean;
        reasoningEnabled?: boolean;
        systemPrompt?: string;
    } = {}
): AsyncGenerator<SimpleStreamPacket> {
    // Use the internal chatWithReasoning method
    for await (const packet of this.chatWithReasoning(message, options)) {
        yield packet;
    }
}
```

### 2. **Updated Client to Use Correct Method**
```typescript
// In ChatClient.ts
const responseGenerator = await this.chatServerModuleProxy.postChatWithReasoning(
    message, 
    {
        jsonOutput: this.jsonOutputMode,
        reasoningEnabled: this.reasoningEnabled
    }
);
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Client**: User types `reasoning on`
2. **Client**: Calls `postChatWithReasoning` method on server
3. **Server**: Uses `chatWithReasoning` from LLMPotoModule
4. **Server**: Returns `SimpleStreamPacket` objects with reasoning and content
5. **Client**: Displays reasoning in gray, content in AI color
6. **Result**: Real-time display of AI thinking process

## Test It

```bash
# In the chat client
> reasoning on
âœ… Reasoning enabled - AI thinking process will be displayed in real-time

> What is the capital of France?
[AI thinking in gray text]
Let me think about this... France is a country in Europe...
The capital of France is Paris.
```

The reasoning display should now work properly with Doubao and other reasoning-enabled models!
