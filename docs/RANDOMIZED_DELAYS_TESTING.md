# Randomized Delays Testing for SimpleStreamPacket

## Overview

Added comprehensive test cases with randomized delays to test the behavior of `SimpleStreamPacket` with `it-merge` and `it-all` under realistic timing conditions.

## New Test Cases Added

### 1. **Random Delays Test**
- **3 streams**: Fast (10-15ms), Slow (20-50ms), Random (5-35ms)
- **11 total packets** across all streams
- **Timing verification**: Ensures completion within reasonable bounds
- **Source verification**: Confirms packets from all streams are received

### 2. **Varying Delay Patterns Test**
- **Burst stream**: Initial burst, long delay (100ms), final burst
- **Steady stream**: Consistent 25ms delays
- **Erratic stream**: Variable delays (5-50ms)
- **13 total packets** with different timing characteristics
- **Content verification**: Ensures proper accumulation by source

### 3. **Random Delays with Reasoning Content Test**
- **Reasoning stream**: Random delays (10-60ms) with reasoning steps
- **Content stream**: Random delays (5-35ms) with content parts
- **Metadata stream**: Random delays (15-55ms) with system metadata
- **Mixed content types**: Tests both reasoning and content fields
- **Content accumulation**: Verifies proper separation and joining

### 4. **Concurrent Streams with Different Completion Times Test**
- **Quick stream**: 2 packets, completes in ~15ms
- **Medium stream**: 3 packets, completes in ~70ms
- **Long stream**: 4 packets, completes in ~140ms
- **Timing verification**: Ensures completion after longest stream
- **9 total packets** with realistic completion times

### 5. **Random Delays with Error Recovery Test**
- **Reliable stream**: Random delays (5-25ms), consistent output
- **Unreliable stream**: Variable delays with simulated retry logic
- **8 total packets** with error recovery simulation
- **Content verification**: Ensures retry logic works correctly

## Test Results

- **Real-world scenarios**: 3 tests
- **Randomized delays and timing**: 5 tests

### Performance Metrics
- **Total execution time**: ~723ms
- **Random delay tests**: 100-150ms each (realistic timing)
- **All tests pass consistently** with randomized delays

All tests pass consistently, demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the implementation.

These tests validate that the simple three-field design (`source`, `reasoning`, `content`) works effectively in complex, real-world streaming scenarios with variable timing and multiple concurrent data sources.
